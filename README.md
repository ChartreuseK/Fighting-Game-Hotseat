# Fighting Game Hotseat

Ever been in a room full of eight or ten nerds, and had a game of street fighter going on? Everyone wants to play, but it's hard to manage the rotation of who gets to play, especially when people are coming and going.

This webapp aims to fix that problem. Enter everyone's name, and start fighting. It will keep track of turn order, win and loss rate, maximum win streaks, and other statistics. 

You can configure it for a variety of turn modes, whether you want to keep the loser in, the winner in, or neither, or if you want to put a cap on how many rounds a winner can play successively. 

This app is built using AngularJS, w3.css, and [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/).

You can find a demo of the app [here](https://ironykins.github.io/Fighting-Game-Hotseat/index.html).
